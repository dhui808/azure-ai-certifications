# Generative AI workloads on Azure
## Generative AI creates original content
Grounding: The process of porviding additional context and real-world information to the model  

## Language models
* Tokennization
* Embedding: creating vectors of the tokens  
  
Transformer model represents relationships between words.  
  * Encoder block - breaks down text and converts it into converts it into a numerical representation,
    or **embedding**  
  * Decoder block - generates answers and predications.

## Responsible AI
* Identifying Harms
* Measuring Harms
* Mitigating Harms
* Following an operation and readiness plan
  
### Mitigating Harms
* Model layer: select a different model or fine-tune a model
* System layer: content filters
* Metaprompt and grounding layer: prompt engineering and grounding
* User experience layer:
