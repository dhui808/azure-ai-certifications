# Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure
* Extract information
* Classify text
* Understand questions and conversational language
* Summarize text
* Tanslate text
* Speech Synthesis

## Metrics of evaluating a language model
* Precision:True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
* Recall:   True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives), percentage of actual positives that the model
  correctly identified.
* F1 Score: Single metric that combines percision and recall. Harmony mean of precision and recall
  F1=2*(Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)  
  
Entity Recognition or **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: identifies and classifies important pieces of information 
(entities) in text.  
Key phrase extraction: the main purpose is to find the main topic of the text  
Aspect-based sentiment analysis: identifying sentiment related to specific aspects or topics within the text  

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML): Giving the speech engine stage directions: pronunciation, pauses, speed, 
pitch, emphasis, voice selection, and more.  

Language modeling: predicts subsequent words based on prior context.
