## Fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure
Maching Learning: creat a model to predict unknown values  
Features: the inputs to a machine‑learning model  
Labels: the output the model is trying to predict  
Training data set and validation dataset  

Azure Automated ML: build and deploy ML models  
* Classification (e.g., fraud detection, churn prediction): predict a category or class 
* Regression (e.g., price prediction): predict numerical value
* Clustering: group items based on features. No label. Unsupervised training
* Time‑series forecasting (e.g., demand forecasting)
* Computer vision (object detection, image classification)
* Natural language processing (text classification, sentiment analysis)
Azure ML Designer: build machine learning pipelines visually

Deep Learning: udentify patterns in the unstructured data  

Data preparation:  
  Cleaning, normalizing, splitting (split data into training and validation sets)  

### Quick Summary of Clustering Scenarios

| Scenario                          | Description                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Customer segmentation             | Find natural customer groups   
| Recommendation systems            | Group similar items  
| Anomaly detection                 | Identify outliers (Fraud, Security, Manufacturing)    
| Image segmentation                | Group similar pixels  
| Gene analysis                     | Discover biological patterns  
| Geographic grouping               | Optimize spatial decisions  
| Document clustering               | Organize large text collections  
| Preprocessing for other ML Tasks  | Improve downstream ML models
